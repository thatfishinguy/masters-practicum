## Previous Research Into Burnout   

This section of research will be a literature review over the previous published research into burnout in a variety of sectors in our society. It will focus on the methods of each of the published papers, limitations and finding from these papers to guide the creation of the survey and methods by which the survey will be distributed.  

## Physician Burnout. 

Physician burnout has been at the center of burnout research for decades because of the crucial role these people play in the health and safety of society. With more and more physicians leaving the workforce because of mental health issues and burnout, a large part of the published studies have been done in this population, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic. 

In a study done during the COVID-19 pandemic, junior and senior doctors in Australia were surveyed during the second wave of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Australia to assess the prevalence of mental health issues, coping strategies and help-seeking behaviors. Demographics, (such as age, sex, state, organization type, household descriptions), mental health status and various methods of coping strategies were all collected by a voluntary survey found on covid-19-frontline.com.au (Pascoe et al., 2021).  

The data covered by this survey indicated increased mental health symptoms being significantly higher than previous studies, especially in junior doctors. This data coupled with low engagement with help-seeking services were areas of concern in this study. Some of the most common coping strategies described in the study included physical exercise, leaning on social support and alcohol consumption. Increased alcohol consumption due to increased mental health strain and burnout is a major concern because of the detrimental health effects this can have on this important sector of the population (Pascoe et al., 2021).   

Some of the limitations of this study included women being overrepresented in the study, the inability for calculation of response rate and limited coping strategies as options (where the free-text input was not utlizied extensively) which could lead to other coping strategies not being adequately represented (Pascoe et al., 2021).  

Another study done in the United States on Emergency Medicine physicians looked into the impact the COVID-19 pandemic, resource availability and institutional support had on well being, burnout and job satisfaction. With the amount of stress and psychological burden inherent in the job of emergency medicine, the stress of a novel respirtory pandemic coupled with staffing and resource concerns, emergency medicine physicians have been a major focus of burnout and wellbeing studies. In this study, an online 18-item survey was administered to emergency medicine physicians to determine the psychological and emotional status of these individuals (Nguyen et al., 2021).  

The survey data showed that 75% of the physicians surveyed reported increased mental health strain and burnout since the start of the pandemic. The data did also point to there being no adequate professional counseling and support for themselves and their peers which has led to lower job satisfaction. Physicians reporting higher job satisfaction also reported there were adequate professional psychological resources (Nguyen et al., 2021).  

The study however pointed out limiations to the study including a low 18.7% response rate and may contribute to some non-repsonse bias, citing potential workload being a barrier to completing the survey. The authors also pointed out that this survey was sent right after a peak in US COVID-19 incidence which could have some effect on institutional resources and support (Nguyen et al., 2021).  

## Parental Burnout. 

Parental burnout is another very important area of study because of the importance of their wellbeing in caring for the next generation of humanity. There have been several studies done to assess the mental health status of parents that are relevant to the study of mental health and burnout in other sectors of the population.  

One study done between Ireland, Norway, Switzerland, the Netherlands and the UK was done to assess the depressive symptoms, anxiety and stress and women's demographics, health and reproductive characteristics. This study was done through the use of the Edinburgh Depression scale, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder seven-item scale (GAD-7) and the percieved stress scale (Ceulemans et al., 2021).  

Researchers were able to analyze the data and look into risk factors that were associated with poor mental health status including having an unplanned pregnancy, having a chronic mental illness, a chronic somatic illness in the postpartum period, smoking and living in the UK or Ireland (Ceulemans et al., 2021). The study found high depressive symptoms and generalized anxiety among preganant and breastfeeding women during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study concluded with a push to underline the importance of mental health in the perinatal period during pandemics and other social criseses to ensure the wellbeing of both the mother and the child (Ceulemans et al., 2021).  

Another study done in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia aimed at understanding the burden created by the COVID-19 pandemic on parents. This study was done in the wake of nearly 1.8 million Australians losing their jobs or working reduced hours as a result of the health measures put on by the Australian government. The study stressed the importance of understanding the factors that are leading to the burnout and strain on mental health for parents as the mental well being of parents impact everyone in their immediate family including children and spouses (Wiemer & Clarkson, 2023).  

The study used the "Parental Burnout Assessment" which is a 23 item self-report measure that ranks responses on a 7 point Likert scale. The particiapnts were recruited through advertising on private Facebook parenting groups in Australia where parents were able to learn more about the study and were provided a link to the survey. Some of the conclusions discussed in the paper include risk factors such as age, gender, number of children and age of children which increased the likelihood of a parent experiencing burnout (Wiemer & Clarkson, 2023).
