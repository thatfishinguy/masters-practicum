</div>


<div id="previous-research-into-burnout" class="section level2">
<h2>Previous Research Into Burnout</h2>
<p>This section of research will be a literature review over the
previous published research into burnout in a variety of sectors in our
society. It will focus on the methods of each of the published papers
and finding from these papers.</p>
</div>
<div id="physician-burnout." class="section level2">
<h2>Physician Burnout.</h2>
<p>Physician burnout has been at the center of burnout research for
decades because of the crucial role these people play in the health and
safety of society. With more and more physicians leaving the workforce
because of mental health issues and burnout, a large part of the
published studies have been done in this population, especially since
the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>In a study done during the COVID-19 pandemic, junior and senior
doctors in Australia were surveyed during the second wave of SARS-CoV-2
pandemic in Australia to assess the prevalence of mental health issues,
coping strategies and help-seeking behaviors. Demographics, (such as
age, sex, state, organization type, household descriptions), mental
health status and various methods of coping strategies were all
collected by a voluntary survey found on covid-19-frontline.com.au.</p>
<p>The data covered by this survey indicated increased mental health
symptoms being significantly higher than previous studies, especially in
junior doctors. This data coupled with low engagement with help-seeking
services were areas of concern in this study. Some of the most common
coping strategies described in the study included physical exercise,
leaning on social support and alcohol consumption. Increased alcohol
consumption due to increased mental health strain and burnout is a major
concern because of the detrimental health effects this can have on this
important sector of the population.</p>
<p>Some of the limitations of this study included women being
overrepresented in the study, the inability for calculation of response
rate and limited coping strategies as options (where the free-text input
was not utlizied extensively) which could lead to other coping
strategies not being adequately represented.</p>
<p>Another study done in the United States on Emergency Medicine
physicians looked into the impact the COVID-19 pandemic, resource
availability and institutional support had on well being, burnout and
job satisfaction. With the amount of stress and psychological burden
inherent in the job of emergency medicine, the stress of a novel
respirtory pandemic coupled with staffing and resource concerns,
emergency medicine physicians have been a major focus of burnout and
wellbeing studies. In this study, an online 18-item survey was
administered to emergency medicine physicians to determine the
psychological and emotional status of these individuals.</p>
<p>The survey data showed that 75% of the physicians surveyed reported
increased mental health strain and burnout since the start of the
pandemic. The data did also point to there being no adequate
professional counseling and support for themselves and their peers which
has led to lower job satisfaction. Physicians reporting higher job
satisfaction also reported there were adequate professional
psychological resources.</p>
<p>The study however pointed out limiations to the study including a low
18.7% response rate and may contribute to some non-repsonse bias, citing
potential workload being a barrier to completing the survey. The authors
also pointed out that this survey was sent right after a peak in US
COVID-19 incidence which could have some effect on institutional
resources and support.</p>
</div>
<div id="parental-burnout." class="section level2">
<h2>Parental Burnout.</h2>
<p>Parental burnout is another very important area of study because of
the importance of their wellbeing in caring for the next generation of
humanity. There have been several studies done to assess the mental
health status of parents that are relevant to the study of mental health
and burnout in other sectors of the population.</p>
<p>One study done between Ireland, Norway, Switzerland, the Netherlands
and the UK was done to assess the depressive symptoms, anxiety and
stress and women’s demographics, health and reproductive
characteristics. This study was done through the use of the Edinburgh
Depression scale, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder seven-item scale
(GAD-7) and the percieved stress scale.</p>
<p>Researchers were able to analyze the data and look into risk factors
that were associated with poor mental health status including having an
unplanned pregnancy, having a chronic mental illness, a chronic somatic
illness in the postpartum period, smoking and living in the UK or
Ireland.</p>
